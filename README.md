## ✨ Features

✅ Visualizes **5 classic sorting algorithms**:
- 🔁 **Bubble Sort**  
- 📥 **Insertion Sort**  
- 🔽 **Selection Sort**  
- ⚡ **Quick Sort**  
- 🧬 **Merge Sort**

✅ **Real-time visual feedback**:
- Color-coded bars show comparisons and swaps  
- Numbers displayed above each bar  
- Animated transitions  
- Displays execution time in seconds after sorting  
- Shows Time and Space Complexity dynamically

✅ **Interactive and beginner-friendly**:
- Sort in ascending 🔼 or descending 🔽 order  
- Instantly reset array with new random values  
- Keyboard-controlled interface for easy use
